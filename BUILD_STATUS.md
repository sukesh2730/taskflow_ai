## 🚀 **RECOMMENDED: Use GitHub Actions**

Since Android SDK setup is complex locally, the **easiest and fastest** way is GitHub Actions:

### Steps (5 minutes):

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "TaskFlow AI v1.1.0 - Ultimate Upgrade Complete"
   git push
   ```

2. **Go to GitHub**:
   - Open your repository
   - Click "Actions" tab
   - Click "Build Android APK" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" button

3. **Wait 5-10 minutes**:
   - GitHub builds your APK in the cloud
   - No local setup needed!

4. **Download APK**:
   - Click on completed workflow
   - Scroll to "Artifacts"
   - Download "taskflow-v1.1.0-release"
   - Extract ZIP to get your APK

## 💻 Alternative: Complete Local Setup

If you want to build locally, you need:

### 1. Install Android SDK
Run: `INSTALL_ANDROID_SDK.bat`

This will:
- Download Android SDK command-line tools
- Install required packages
- Configure environment variables
- Accept licenses

### 2. Then Build
```bash
cd taskflow_mobile
flutter build apk --release
```

**Time Required**: 30-45 minutes for first-time setup
